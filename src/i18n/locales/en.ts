  restfulDetailBody: `My focus: clear resource modeling, explicit versioning, predictable pagination & filtering, robust auth, and strong observability. I treat the OpenAPI contract as a living source of truthâ€”kept lean, human readable and always in sync with implementation. Version strategy (URI or header) is applied pragmatically to minimize breaking changes.

Quality is enforced with contract tests (schema drift detection), integration suites and load probes early in the lifecycle. Metrics and structured logs feed back into iterative hardening. I enjoy simplifying complexity: fewer endpoints, smarter composition, better docs. If you need a reliable backend foundation that scales without turning opaque, let's talk.`,
