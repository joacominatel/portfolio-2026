    "Tools and approaches I enjoy when building data-driven and automated backends.",
  dataAutomationDetailBody: `I like mixing pragmatic tooling with modern runtimes. Python stays at the core (FastAPI, async workers) for expressiveness, while I complement with Go or Node when concurrency or streaming patterns demand tighter control.

For data orchestration and pipelines: plain queues (Redis / SQS) plus lightweight schedulers beat over-engineered DAG monsters most of the time. I lean on SQL (Postgres / MySQL / analytical extensions) for truth, and use Redis or inâ€‘memory caches only where latency truly matters.

Observability matters early: structured logs, trace ids that flow across tasks, and small metrics (p95 latency, queue depth) give fast feedback loops. I prototype with Docker Compose, then push to containers on cloud (Azure / AWS) using IaC templates.

AI integration: I like using LLMs to augment extraction, validation or summarization stepsâ€”never as an opaque black box. Guardrails + deterministic fallbacks keep pipelines stable.

I keep things simple: fewer moving parts, clear contracts, documented behaviors, reproducible local runs.`,
  aboutMeBody: `Hi, I'm Joaquin (Joaco), a backend developer focused on Python and the craft of clear REST APIs, robust data flows and AI-assisted features. I enjoy turning loosely defined problems into concise architectures: small services with explicit boundaries, predictable performance and solid observability.

I favour simple, composable designs over fashionable complexityâ€”versioned endpoints, typed contracts, repeatable pipelines, meaningful tests. I collaborate with teams or solo on freelance projects, bringing documentation, clean commits, CI testing and iterative delivery.

If you need someone to design or reinforce a backend foundation (APIs, data processing, automation, AI integration) with maintainable quality, let's talk.`,

    "I design and build REST APIs that are clear, reliable, and easy to evolve.",
  restfulDetailBody: `I like working on APIs that are well thought out: resources with clear logic, consistent versioning, and OpenAPI documentation that always matches the real implementation. The goal is for anyone consuming the API to have a predictable experience, without surprises.

Quality is ensured through contract, integration, and load testing, making sure every change keeps the system stable. I focus on simplicity: fewer endpoints but better designed, easier to maintain and scale. If youâ€™re looking for a solid and transparent backend foundation, letâ€™s work together.`,
